# Hirst Painting with Python Turtle

This Python program uses the Turtle module to create a Hirst painting. The painting consists of a grid of colored dots, inspired by the works of artist Damien Hirst.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the `turtle` module installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install PythonTurtle
    ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the program files are located.
3. Run the program by executing the following command:
    ```
    python Hirst_painting.py
    ```
4. A window will open displaying the Hirst painting. Click anywhere on the window to close it.

## Customization

You can customize the painting by modifying the parameters in the Python script:
- `list_rgb`: This list contains RGB tuples representing the colors used in the painting. You can add or remove colors as desired.
- Adjust the loop parameters (`h` and `v`) to change the size and density of the grid.
