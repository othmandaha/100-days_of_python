# Day 28 - Pomodoro App
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built using Python's Tkinter library.

## Description

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This application helps you implement the Pomodoro Technique by providing a visual timer that counts down work intervals, short breaks, and long breaks.

## Features

- Set work intervals for 25 minutes.
- Set short breaks for 5 minutes.
- Set long breaks for 20 minutes.
- Automatically switches between work intervals and breaks.
- Keeps track of completed work intervals with checkmarks.
