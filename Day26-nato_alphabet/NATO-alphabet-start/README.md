# Day 26 - NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

This Python script reads the NATO phonetic alphabet from a CSV file and converts a user-entered word into its corresponding phonetic codes.

## Requirements:

    pandas library (https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Instructions:

    Save the script as a Python file (e.g., nato_converter.py).
    Ensure the nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv file is in the same directory as the script. This CSV file should have two columns: letter and code.
    Run the script from the command line: python nato_converter.py
    Enter a word when prompted.
    The script will print the list of NATO phonetic codes corresponding to each letter in the word.

## Example CSV File (nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv):

letter,code
A,Alfa
B,Bravo
C,Charlie
...
Z,Zulu

## Example Usage:

Enter a word: HELLO

['Hotel', 'Echo', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Oscar']
